# Credit Card Collections System

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

A modular **Credit Card Operations System** built with **Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Redis**.  
This project serves as a foundation for managing credit card client accounts, payments, and collections, designed to be scalable for additional modules such as **Billing** and **Fraud Management**.

## Overview
This system provides a backend API for managing credit card clients and collections.  
Key goals include:
- Tracking client balances and payments
- Fast balance lookups using Redis caching
- Scalable modular design to add **Billing** and **Fraud Detection** modules in future phases

---

## Features
- **Clients Management**: Add, update, delete, and list clients  
- **Payments Management**: Record payments with method, notes, and timestamp  
- **Collections Module**: Automated balance computation and caching  
- **API Documentation**: Interactive OpenAPI docs via FastAPI  
- **Dockerized Environment**: PostgreSQL and Redis ready-to-use
